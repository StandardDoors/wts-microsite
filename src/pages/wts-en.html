    <h3>Due to glass supply issues, we must update our LowE PLUS IG configuration. While the new configuration passes Energy Star, we are waiting for NRCAN to publish the official results.  We expect our software to be revised within a few weeks, so the NRCAN values appear on quotations and orders.</h3>
    <h3>For any orders that require energy star, we will keep track of them manually and issue Energy Star Stickers as soon as possible.</h3>
    <h3>If you have any questions, please contact your sales representative. We apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your understanding.</h3>
